# Download:
Last [ `Blender 2,78 r=1.20`] (https://github.com/Spirou4D/stencil_widget/blob/master/download/stencil_widget.zip)

# Addon explanations:

This addon is the original work of kgeogeo. this tool is used to manipulate textures and now masks when you paint with paint brushes (or sculpt brushes too).
You can with buttons and/or numeric keyboard:
- rotate
- scale stencil XY
- scale X
- scale Y
- scale texture UV
- scale U
- scale V
- offset texture U
- offset texture V
- change opacity between 50% to 0.
- scale precisely with two mesurements on your texture and object.

# Shortcuts:

Ctrl + Shift + Q => Stencil Widget

Shift + Alt +Q => Mask Stencil Widget

# Uses:
1 - When the widget is visible, you can move it with the midlle circle (#0) to change the center of rotation, offset and scale

2 - if you click between the midlle circle and the extern circle, you can move the widget and the texture both together.

3 - Extern button circle:
- if you use the button with one click and slide, the setup is interractif (if you stay on button, the feature is precise to 0.01, if you slide out of the last circle, the feature is to all 0.5)
- if you use the button with one click alone and type the angle's number, or scale's number or etc... in numerical keysboard, the setup is numeric and precise instantly.
- if you click outside the button, the widget exit, disappear.

BUT if you a new one run the widget, his position and setups stay always, no change!

# Options: #11 button i.e.  "Scale intuitive mode":
You can draw two lines one after the other with two clicks and slides: 
- RED: the first for the size you want.
- BLUE: the second for the size you have.
And the widget change automatiquely the texture scale.

# Remark: 
This new mask stencil use is usable for Paint, Vertex-Paint and Sculpt mode.


And "Voil√†"!
